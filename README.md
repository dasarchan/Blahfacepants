### Hi there!

I'm Archan (he/him), a first year Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University. I like programming computers to do cool things, a couple of which are on this profile. I'm interested in a lot of things, including complex social networks, autonomous robot control, and natural language processing.

I'm proficient in:
- Python
- Java
- C#
- Git
- Salesforce


I'm still working on:
- C/C++
- Tableau
- R
- React/Svelte/JS
